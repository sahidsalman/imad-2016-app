Please obtain your boarding pass from the Check-in counter, 75 minutes (international sector) / 45 minutes(domestic sector) prior to departure. For all travel on/up to 31st Jan 2016, due to high security alert and congestion at airport, our check in counters will close 60 minutes prior to the departure. Failure to do so will result in your booking being cancelled and the fares and surcharges retained. Report early for hassle free checkin.

Please report at your departure gate at the indicated boarding time. Any passenger failing to report in time, may be refused boarding privileges.
